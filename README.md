This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the Project

1. Open a terminal window and go to the root directory of this project
2. Ensure that `yarn` is installed - I'm using v1.22.4 -
3. For best results, run the project in the Node version indicated in the `.nvmrc` file. If you have `nvm` installed on a Unix-based machine, you can run `nvm use` - the Node version may need to be installed if it's not yet
4. Enter `yarn dev` on the command line
5. Open the browser in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
